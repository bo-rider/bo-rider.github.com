                            My name is <b>Borys Olekhnovych</b> and I am web/graphic designer from L'viv, Ukraine. <br>
                            In my works I use professional experience gained in the last four years of practice and also my intuition :)
                            <br>Always try to learn something new and explore opportunities for professional improvements.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Knowledge and Experience</h2>
                        <p>Since I got interested and started to work in web design I was able to work with many
                           interesting people on interesting projects, which is turn left in a very valuable experience.
                           Experience in ability to understand customer wishes and feel what he exactly need for solving his problem,
                           what the product realy must be able to do for it. In other side, i try to put myself in "user place"
                           for feel what they want and what they wait from such products or services. Then i just try to create
                           such kind of end product us if i will be using it by myself with big pleasure :).
